Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where you attempt to discover a hidden word by guessing individual letters. 
This Python program allows you to play the Hangman game. 
You have a limited number of lives to guess the correct letters and reveal the hidden word.

Run the Python script.

The program will select a random word from a predefined word list.

You will see the initial state of the word represented by underscores.
Guess a letter by typing it and pressing Enter.
If your guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word.
If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a life, and a part of the hangman will be drawn.

If you run out of lives, you lose the game, and the hidden word is revealed.
